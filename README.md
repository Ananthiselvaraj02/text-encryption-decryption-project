 Text Encryption/Decryption Project

This project provides a simple implementation of text encryption and decryption using a chosen algorithm. It allows users to encrypt plain text messages into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back to plain text using a secret key.

## Features

- Encryption of plain text messages into ciphertext.
- Decryption of ciphertext back to plain text using the secret key.
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI).
- using ash value algorithm based this process is run
